### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2   | - Study EC2 core concepts including Instance types, AMIs, Key Pairs, differences between EBS and Instance Store, and practice launching an instance with User Data configuration <br>                                                                                                    | 09/22/2025 | 09/22/2025      |
| 3   | - Learn about EC2 Auto Scaling and Pricing options, then proceed to Lab 13 to deploy AWS Backup infrastructure, create a backup plan, and test the restoration process. <br>                                              | 09/23/2025 | 09/23/2025      |  |
| 4   | - Complete Lab 24 by setting up an EC2 for Storage Gateway, activating the Gateway, and creating File Shares. Start Lab 57 by creating an S3 bucket and loading initial data. <br>  | 09/24/2025 | 09/24/2025      |  |
| 5   | - Continue Lab 57 by enabling Static Website Hosting on S3, configuring public access settings, and setting up an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve the website content. <br>                              | 09/25/2025 | 09/25/2025      |  |
| 6   | - Finalize Lab 57 by exploring advanced features like Bucket Versioning, Lifecycle rules (moving objects), and Multi-Region Replication, followed by a complete resource cleanup. <br>          | 09/26/2025 | 09/26/2025      |  |
