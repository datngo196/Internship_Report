### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |

| 2   | - Deep dive into Lab 25 advanced features including creating file shares, testing and monitoring performance, enabling data deduplication, shadow copies, and managing user sessions and storage quotas. <br>  | 10/06/2025 | 10/06/2025      |
| 3   | - Finalize Lab 25 by practicing throughput and storage scaling, then delete the environment. Start Lab 57 by creating an S3 bucket, loading data, and enabling static website hosting features. <br>     | 10/07/2025 | 10/07/2025      |  |
| 4   | - Continue Lab 57 by configuring public access blocks and public objects, then set up and test an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve the static website content with low latency. <br> | 10/08/2025 | 10/08/2025      |  |
| 5   | - Complete Lab 57 with data management tasks: implementing Bucket Versioning, moving objects via Lifecycle rules, configuring Multi-Region Replication, and finally cleaning up all Lab resources. <br>   | 10/09/2025 | 10/09/2025      |  |
| 6   | - Begin Module 05 by studying the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, understanding the core concepts of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and getting an overview of Amazon Cognito. <br> | 10/10/2025 | 10/10/2025      |  |
