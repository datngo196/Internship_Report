| 6   | - Practice creating a Custom Cost Budget and a Usage Budget (e.g., limiting EC2 hours). Research AWS Support packages (Basic, Developer, Business, Enterprise). Clean up resources (Clean Up Budgets) <br>  | 09/05/2025 | 09/05/2025  | 

### Week 1 Achievements:

- Understood the Cloud definition: On-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Mastered core benefits, including cost optimization and the ability to elastically scale resources.
- Understood Global Infrastructure: Availability Zones (AZs) are key for fault isolation, and deploying across a minimum of 2 AZs is recommended for high availability.
- Completed account creation and security setup: MFA was successfully configured for the Root User.
- Created the IAM Admin Group and User, adhering to the security best practice of restricting Root User access.
- Familiarized with cost models: On-Demand (highest cost), Long-term commitment (RI/Saving Plans), and Temporary/Spare capacity (Spot Instances, up to 90% discount).
- Successfully set up AWS Budgets to monitor costs (Cost Budget) and track resource consumption limits (Usage Budget).
- Differentiated the 4 main AWS Support tiers (Basic free tier, Developer, Business, Enterprise)
