### Week 11 Objectives:

- Master NoSQL database design and operations using Amazon DynamoDB (Backup, Global Tables).
- Implement cost allocation strategies using Tagging and Cost Management tools.
- Utilize AWS developer tools (CloudShell, SDK) for programmatic resource management.
- Perform visual data preparation, profiling, and cleaning using AWS Glue DataBrew.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2   | - Deep dive into Amazon DynamoDB (Lab 39): Explore the console, perform backup/restore operations, and study advanced design patterns for building global serverless applications. <br>| 11/10/2025 | 11/10/2025      |
| 3   | - Complete Lab 40 focusing on Cost Allocation: Build a database, populate data, apply tagging strategies to track usage, and query cost allocation tags to understand spending patterns. <br>     | 11/11/2025 | 11/11/2025      |  |
| 4   | - Perform Lab 60 to practice managing AWS resources using command-line interfaces: Amazon CloudShell and the AWS SDK, understanding the difference between Console and programmatic access. <br>  | 11/12/2025 | 11/12/2025      |  |
| 5   | - Begin Lab 70 for data preparation: Launch a Cloud9 environment, download and upload datasets to S3, set up AWS Glue DataBrew, and run data profiling to understand data quality. <br>    | 11/13/2025 | 11/13/2025      |  |
| 6   | - Finalize Lab 70 by cleaning and transforming data with DataBrew recipes. Proceed to Lab 72 to ingest, store, and catalog data into the AWS Glue Data Catalog, then clean up all resources. <br> | 11/14/2025 | 11/14/2025      |  |
