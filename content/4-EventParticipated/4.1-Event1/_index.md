### Key Takeaways

#### Architecture Patterns
- **Serverless First**: Most solutions (Chatbot, Trading, Internal Tools) prioritize Serverless architecture to optimize costs and operations.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: A trend shifting from single-task to coordinated multi-agent systems to solve complex processes (Audit, Banking processes).
- **RAG & Context Handling**: RAG techniques and context handling (MCP) are key to making Chatbots useful in an enterprise environment.

#### Business Impact
- **Personalization**: GenAI plays a core role in personalizing user experiences (eCommerce, Recipe apps).
- **Automation Efficiency**: Automating traditional, labor-intensive processes like Auditing or contract processing.

### Applying to Work

- **Deploy RAG**: Apply Serverless RAG models for the company's internal Knowledge Bases.
- **Experiment with Multi-Agent**: Research and apply multi-agent workflows for complex tasks requiring multi-step coordination.
- **Context Optimization**: Improve current Chatbots by applying Context Handling (like MCP) for more natural responses.
- **Adoption of Amazon Nova/Tools**: Explore and integrate new tools like Amazon Nova Act or Kiro IDE into the development process.
